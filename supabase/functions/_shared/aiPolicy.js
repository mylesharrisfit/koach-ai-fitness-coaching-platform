/**
 * THE definition of an "AI generation", and which plan each AI feature needs.
 * (Client mirror of the counted list: src/lib/aiPolicy.js — a test fails if they differ.)
 *
 * COUNTED — each successful-to-start call is exactly 1 generation against the
 * coach's monthly allowance (TIER_LIMITS[tier].max_ai_generations_per_month);
 * regenerating counts again:
 *   - generateAIProgram   a workout program
 *   - generateMealPlan    a meal plan
 *   - generateSmartMeals  a smart-meals set
 * (AI onboarding is these same calls, so it is counted too, and needs Pro+.)
 *
 * NOT COUNTED — check-in summaries, draft replies, the full assistant, insights,
 * scans and import mapping never touch the counter. They are only limited by
 * the plan's feature flag (`feature`), checked server-side in guardAiUse().
 *
 * Comped / admin accounts are evaluated as Enterprise (see effectiveTier).
